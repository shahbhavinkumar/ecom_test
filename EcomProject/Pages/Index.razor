    <p>
        This project is assuming that you can either have a Rating or Work Key or none. </p>
    <p> Also, please make sure the settings in appsettings in API project are correct. Currently its looking following vital configs</p>

    <p>DataURL : which is the searchFile downloaded from the dumps on the openlibrary</p>
    <p>EndPointURL : which is the https://openlibrary.org</p>
    <p>SaveJsonFilePath : which is the path where the json files are saved</p>
     
      <p>Currently, it's not looking at the edition when search for a book according to problem statement, but taking the first or default book, since there is no mention of which
          edition is to be selected etc. The project is broken down into 3 sub projects, one for Client, Other for API and Shared for POCO's. No Db was used since it did not seem to be a requirement.
      </p>

   <p>Few notable concepts to look for here are Virtualization in Blazor, Swagger for testing the API Endpoints, Caching on the API for search data</p>
